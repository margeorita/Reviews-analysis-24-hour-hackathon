1,"It is good that there is AIR MILES REWARDS PROGRAM because I love collecting points and use it like buying food, gas, vacation, or pay it to hotels. Continue to buy in the participating store listed to continue to collect the rewards and then we are fully rewarded for the free stuffs in exchanged of points. Thank you Air Miles for your program. Every body is enjoying the benefits of the program. Keep up the good work",no negative,5
2,"2nd UPDATE: Uninstalled and reinstalled the app like the developers suggested. A useless solution since the app is still the same version 5.6 UPDATE: I emailed Air Mile and this is the response I received. ""The group mobileappsupport only accepts messages from people in its organization or on its allowed senders list, and your email address isn't on the list."" Been waiting and waiting to be able to take part in the Carousel of Dreams but my app still has not updated",no negative,4
3,no positive,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with the previous version. This one stinks real bad. So I uninstalled, installed again and now I have the previous one that works again. I'll never understand the mind(empty)set of this current generation of developers",1
4,no positive,"The Carousel of dreams banner in rhe app worked for 2 days and now it doesn't show so I can't play. Yes I tried reloading, rebooting, and clearing the app cache... a few times! Nothing seems to work. Help line didn't help.",1
5,no positive,Disappointed as I am unable to play the carousel of dreams. It is November 4th...last update on Google play was on October 28th (a week after this started) and today this is still not available on the app. Have deleted the app twice and it still doesn't show up. Maybe because I am in Canada?,3
6,no positive,"What the ...! Installed, it is the latest version! Kept geting email/text to get the app to enter Carousel of Dreams contest only available on app, Don't think I'm going to win anything, app is useless ( can't open contest) card is also hidden! Frustrating waste of time",1
7,no positive,"Well everything was working fine until the last update. Now whenever I try to login it says ""something went wrong"". Not sure how hard it is to update the app without breaking it. Really want it to get fixed soon.",3
8,no positive,I just installed it and it says i have to update it....really?? Says i don't have the lastest and that's why i don't have the carrousel of Dreams... This message popped up the first time i opened the app...i didn't even have a chance to try and find it within the app.... So why are u soliciting to install the app for the carousel of Dreams when clearly there is a problem with this app (as many others have mentioned),1
9,no positive,"The problem I have with the app is that there is no search feature for the merchandise rewards. This is an issue with the Apple version as well. As it is, I have to scroll through the categories to find what I'm looking for. I'd probably give it a 5 star rating if this was fixed.",2
10,no positive,"Suddenly, the app shuts down upon entering my login info. Just deleting it, Air Miles are just a waste of time lately, lots of vendors dropping them!",1
11,no positive,"App did not work. Downloaded App tried to open several times, message App stopped working. After several attempts I Uninstalled the App.",1
12,I love this app it's pretty cool but what I love more is the air miles and dream miles I can't wait to actually use them for trips and stuff or I could fly anywhere thank you so much for coming up with this special program I love you guys,no negative,5
13,no positive,"EDIT 5: Responding to your comments that I should have Android 13 and App version 5.8.1 and try downloading on data. App version 5.8.1 is not in the Google Play Store as noted in the app info screen. App info screen states version available to be 5.7. Info screen also says minimum Android OS is 5 or higher. So requirements need to be updated in the store and the ability to download 5.8.1 needs to be available. Again, lack of proper support. No wonder companies are leaving the Air Miles program.",1
14,no positive,Functions in the app are consistently not working and advising to update the app regularly. When you go to the app settings or app store there are no updates available,2
15,no positive,Having issue getting my air miles. This happens all the time. I didn't get my 20 point from carousel of dreams and I am constantly missing points from shopping. Getting kind of sick of it,3

17,"I switched to cash miles, and the app makes it super simple to collect and redeem. I find cash miles are much more worth it than dream miles ever were. It took me 5 years to get enough dream miles for an air fryer. I have redeemed enough cash miles in the last year to buy the air fryer 3 times over.",no negative,5
18,no positive,I can't get the app to work anymore. It sends me to Firefox and does nothing. What happened to the app?,1
19,no positive,Carousel of Dreams... Not showing up in app anymore... Another failure by this Company it worked better when it was Canadian owned. Time to uninstall,1
20,no positive,Still crashing repeatedly... Each install it is the same thing have tried 14 times so far  its still crashing...,1
21,no positive,So I have no room on my phone to update this app. So therefore it doesn't work. What a piece of work you people are. Now I know why Empire (safeway) has ended its affiliation with you,1
22,I have had nothing but amazing service with AirMiles. So helpful customer service people and very knowledgeable.,no negative,5
23,no positive,It always logs me out of my account even though no one else has access to it and I'm losing points. And I can't even recover my old airmiles with my points,1
24,no positive,Can't update the app to enter the carousel dream contest. I've uninstalled and installed again and doesn't work,1
25,no positive,The app rarely works. Haven't been able to open the app for 2 weeks,1
26,no positive,New update won't open the app. Error message.,1
27,no positive,"How frustrating!! Normally I love this app. But today, I was 7nable to show my card because the damn update button took over the screen and wouldn't let me show my card while in line!! Hokding me to, the other customers behind me and the cashier!! There should be an option to update later!!! NOT BE FORCED!!!!!!!",1
28,no positive,"The app has the option to act as toy digital card which is really convenient until the moment that a new version is released: in first place, there is no way to open the app without updating which make it unusable. And on the other hand if something went wrong it finished your session, so the app asks you again for the collector number which is not convenient. The main use of this app for me is the digital card because in that way I don't need to carry another card (cards for everything). Thanks for fixing these bugs in the future updates.",3
29,no positive,Not real happy with this program I literally struggle to get 95 air miles which gives me 10$ in free groceries......also everything need to be bought in 2s or 4s like I can barely buy 1 of anything... I have the feeling they are just watching and selling my buying information and habits,2
30,no positive,"Terrible app but even worse customer service, I would never in a million years book a trip or make a large purchase using air miles. When u need them (even as onyx) they are useless, and thats if you can wait through the half hour waiting time for your ""preferred service"" lol They have made it increasingly difficult to redeem coupons and special offers over the last few years (not by mistake). In the process of closing my membership and moving to a better managed rewards program",1
31,no positive,"Air miles is a joke, they get to track what you buy and when. In return, you get nothing. I linked my bmo account to air miles, 1 mile for every $30 spent. And for the past 2 years nothing, even the odd promotion from Safeway didn't show up. And no, the account wasn't closed or dormant as miles were added daily or every other day. You guys are just collecting data on people's buying habits and getting it for free, scam",1
32,no positive,Skill questions are fraudulent. You answer correctly and says you are wrong. Eg. 5 x 10 = 50 add 100 = 150 devide by 3 = 50 Then subtract 10 The answer can only be 40 But THEY say my answer is wrong BULL#$$%%,1
33,no positive,"Does not work on my tablet, I can only get the card barcode but no access to my account or any other information",2
34,no positive,"Air Miles it's a SCAM, on my app it shows that I have $247 Cash miles but when I tried to redeem at Metro or Shell it said that I have $0 .... A total SCAM !!!",1
35,no positive,"With Sobeys brands abandoning Air Miles I have nowhere I would shop that takes the card, thus uninstalling now",3
36,no positive,I have the most recent update if the app but not able to see carousel of dreams game. V5.6,1
37,no positive,"Not very user friendly, customer service is like CBI/FBI, you cannot get help when you need the most, not sure why I am still collecting Airmiles",1
38,no positive,Still has the same problem that is a subject of all of the complaints...it only shows an image of the card,1
39,no positive,Air miles is the biggest scam out there. Can't use you miles for a trip since the fees cost as much as the flight anyway. And can't use them how you want since you can switch the miles over from dream to cash. The dream miles are a waste and they will not help anyone out. Not like they didn't have to change a policy years ago when they said the miles would expire and average people had to kick up a stink since it takes like 10+ years to save enough miles for a small trip and the fees are too mu,1
40,no positive,"What's happening with this app? For the last week it keeps cutting off saying ""unfortunately air miles has stopped working"" so I uninstalled the app and installed it again and it started doing the same thing again right away. Can someone tell me why?",3
41,no positive,"The latest update forces the app to maximum brightness when you display your card, very useful. But there's no way to change the brightness or colour scheme of the app generally, which is too bright. There's also no way to select notification preferences for promotions, so I've had to block notifications for the whole app.",3
42,no positive,t won't let me play carousel of dreams..keeps saying wrong answer and I never even tapped a bag,1
43,no positive,Can't sign in it doesn't respond!,1
44,no positive,Requirement to load card is dated. it ahould autoload to maximize savings / points accumulation at all times. To have to access an app which requires your card and password constantly (clears with updates) means you cannot leave the card at home so defeats purpoae of app on phone. simply poor execution and lack of consideration of actual user needs.,1
45,no positive,"You can't view your list of saved rewards in this app. The organization of everything is poor. Can't search by what you can afford only, they show you things out of your price range then when you can get them they will have been removed. Air miles is a terrible reward program for your return vs dollar spent and should not be supported.",2
46,no positive,"Sadly, the Air Miles program is such a waste of time, we may even walk away from decades of accumulation due to absolutely useless rewards and probably the worse accumulation ratios on the planet. They cannot even convert their OWN rewards between their OWN rewards programs. It is such a poorly designed system. We could get, it seems, an led light bulb. WooHoo, and 40W at that. We could not get a 2nd one tho before it burnt out! Pretty bad considering LED lifetimes",1
47,no positive,"No longer showing the transactions. The transactions are way behind compared to what you see when you logon through the website. Very laggy in terms of updates, please improve the accuracy and sync it properly with your servers. Used to be a better app at times but has gone worse again.",1
48,no positive,"All this app does is show a digital image of the card. No menu, nothing else. Used to offer more functions. Updated app, nothing changed. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled and still just an image of the card. Unhappy.",1
49,no positive,"The phone lines to book a rental car are only good if you can actually get through. After waiting for 4 hours online and asking for a call-back yesterday, and an hour today (I'm still waiting) an operator in the chat, which can't help you rent a car, told me that they are not even hiring. So, this terrible level of customer service is completely acceptable to Air Miles.",1
50,no positive,"A little disappointed. We had earned enough points to travel to Europe. Before it was 9000/Air Miles points per person to go to Europe. Now it's 1000/Dream points, and $1,700 in taxes  fees for 2 people. Checking the prices with the direct airlines, the total cost is $1,700. By selecting the Air Miles option, we are spending 1000 points with no benefit. Through their app, 1000 points equals $42. On their vacation package, there is a cap on how many Air Miles that you are allowed to use.",1
51,no positive,"Should not have to update app over mobile data to be able to scan the card. Update 2: The app works fine when updated, but that's exactly my complaint - why does the app need to be updated in order to scan the air miles collector number? Why not let an out of date app have limited functionality to show the barcode that hasn't changed in years rather than forcing people to use mobile data in a store to update the app?",2
52,no positive,I want to be able to have 2 separate air miles on my phone because I shop separately and for an elderly couple and want to give them their points. But it just referring to him I successfully completed. Now I want a separate one for myself in a separate app and I can't seem to do it.,2
53,no positive,At the time of a large purchase the app requested a mandatory update. After the update asked for the card number and pin; this all happening while im at a cash register. Deleting app. Supposed to be convenient ?? I use and recommend Stocard. Doesn't ask for an update when you just want to show your card and stores all your cards,1
54,no positive,"Have a few miles saved up which are currently useless to me. Looking to cash some in on a reward but ""There are no rewards for you at the moment."" Been like this for over 24hrs. Tough enough to save up enough miles to be worth using and now can't use them. Will be taking a serious look at whether to continue using this ""rewards"" program.",1
55,"Love being an Airmiles collector been doing it for years and have scored plenty of free merchandise and cash vouchers. I highly recommend getting a BMO airmiles bank account to earn faster, doing so pays for my monthly plan fee amd then some. Just recently a huge disappointment when the LCBO stop being a participating partner.",no negative,4
56,no positive,Bulk-delete of old notifications would be helpful. Can't contact CSR within ap,3
57,no positive,"After signing in, app only displays digital AM card for scanning purposes. No links, profile settings or any functionality at all. So it is pretty much useless",1
58,Works quickly easy to follow,no negative,4
59,no positive,Basically a useless compared to the website. It's shows your balances and offers and shows what you can buy but you can't buy it on the app and you can't even save them for later!! HOW HARD WOULD IT BE TO MAKE A WISH LIST???,2
60,no positive,Such a pain to have to go into the app and click all the plus symbols on each and every offer. Then when a new offer comes up you have to repeat the exercise again . PC optimum app only requires you to log into the app for all the offers to load.,3
61,no positive,Air Miles wont let you use miles for both travel and gift cards. If you select travel your stuck using them only on travel. Air miles is not flexible during a pandemic to even provide a one time transfer...horrible...,1

63,"Very good app, offers can be benefited from instantl",no negative,4
64,no positive,"Decent app, but Air Miles overall just has gone so downhill. Especially since their biggest partner, Sobeys, has dropped them in favour of Scene+. I don't see Air Miles being around in the next few years.",1
65,no positive,I got Air miles and optimum. optimum gives me so much more I use both around the same amount and still only $30 air miles $ 130 optimum card something not right! When metro uses air miles and are way more expensive then no frills etc give you more for your buck wayne canada ????,1
66,Air Miles used be my favorite rewards program until Sobeys dropped them,no negative,5
67,no positive,"Junk app, junk program.",1
68,no positive,"Missing points and no where is there any clear answer as to why. I just keep getting told it takes 10 days. To 30 days. Almost at 30 seats and the promotion will be over by the time it's fixed. If it gets resolved at all that is. Sneaky, sneaky.",2

70,no positive,Have to enter card number everytime you log in. Years behind almost every other App. Hard to navigate.... usually revert to desktop which is no better but has a real keyboard and mouse,1
71,no positive,"Thank you, I've done what you've suggested and it worked.. But please don't fix is'nt broke! Plus those of us who shop at the ligor store, we are lossing on a great deal of points! You can't get everything from an altenivtive store that sells beer and win?! Not everyone drinks the same thing?!",3
72,no positive,"I totally understand you need to be updated, but why not to make the bar code still available when the update request popping up? I was at a gas station, doing the transaction, not able to wait for your update installed first then scan my phone! Think of users' experience please.",1
73,no positive,"Not what it was, the amount of money to spend is high for the points you get, alot of points youll never get, just from false advertising, any clame to get you points are long 90 to 120 days, not worth the time anymore, id stay around pc points more",1
74,no positive,I'm disturbed at how it takes 120 days for points to show up?! I've been sitting at the same points balance for months and I'm wondering why the delay- I don't remember it taking this long previously and what's the thought process behind how a person is supposed to be able to track all the points to be applied over that long of a period...I'm hopeful yet skeptical amd far from impressed,2
75,no positive,You cannot login using your email address and if you do not have your Air Miles number you cannot login. To get your number or recove access they ask you to call them. They don't pick up the phone. You are locked out but also locked up in a loop.,1
76,I have always liked the air miles program as it helps people both low income as well as people who like to travel earn rewards for things like free airplane rides,no negative,4
77,no positive,The app will not load on my tablet.,1

81,no positive,Useless for mobile card. Merchant cannot scan the virtual card barcode and want the number of the card to enter in terminal. but the app only shows 8 digits of your card number and not the whole thing. so you cannot collect your miles. waste of phone space,1
82,no positive,"When app is loaded it does not have a digital card which is the reason I would want this app. Also, there is no help/contact area to get information not on the faq. not useable or user friendly.",1
83,no positive,Terrible app it signs itself out and you lose that chance to collect points when you realize it did it again at the check out and without the phisical card you can't sign yourself back on. Petty stupid on the part of the designers,1
84,no positive,"This app is useless when you want to track your order. Sign in wouldn't recognize my security answer. Kept telling me to enter my answer. My pin was then blocked, requested a new pin through email ... Email link wouldn't work. Grrr",2
85,no positive,"Totally incompetent company. Doesn't ship your orders . Cancels them on you. Sends emails from misc addresses that go to junk, for you to ""call them"" about your acct, then never answers phone for over 2 hrs on hold/3 days in a row. Dumping them  the associated credit cards. Do yourself a favour  collect Aeroplan miles. - on live chat for the 4th time. Incompetent agents say ""wait i will look into it"", then disconnect you when you take longer than 10 seconds to reply when they randomly return",1
86,no positive,It's very annoying that I cant sign in with an email. I get logged out by the app but don't notice until I need to use it. Then I cant log back in until I can look up my card number when I get home.,2
87,You get air miles with every purchase it's a great way to build up some air miles for some money off your purchases It is very easy to use and worthwhile get yourself an Air Miles Card you won't be sorry what can it hurt all you do is make money or save money on your purchases anybody can use that so it's worth while so get yourself one today,no negative,5
88,no positive,uninstalled because I lost interest in airmiles. Too hard to accumulate points and not much to get. Not that many retailers accept it. PR debacle a few years ago and after that kinda left a bad taste,1
